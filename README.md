Clojure NetworkInterface. java.net.NetworkInterface class wrapper.


## Usage

Get network interface by name:

    => (by-name "eth3")
    #<NetworkInterface name:eth3 (Intel(R) 82579LM Gigabit Network Connection)>

Get list of network interfaces as an Enumeration<NetworkInterface> with:

    => (network-interfaces)
    #<java.net.NetworkInterface$2@1f1b62ff>

Get list of network interfaces as an EnumerationSeq with:

    => (network-interfaces :opts)
    #(#<NetworkInterface name:lo (Software Loopback Interface 1)> #<NetworkInterface name:net0 (WAN Miniport (SSTP))>...#<NetworkInterface name:eth3          (Intel(R) 82579LM Gigabit Network Connection)> #<NetworkInterface name:wlan0 (Dell Wireless 1504 802.11b/g/n (2.4GHz))>...

Get the Inet Addresses from network interface as an EnumerationSeq with:

    => (inet-addresses (by-name "wlan0") :ips)
    #(#<Inet4Address /192.168.100.3> #<Inet6Address /fe80:0:0:0:c52d:8f2f:2bfc:f120%wlan0>)

Check if network interface is up and running with:

    => (up? (by-name "wlan0"))
    true

Check if network interface is a loopback interface with:

    => (loopback? (by-name "lo"))
    true
